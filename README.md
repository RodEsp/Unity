Unity
=====

A very simple single-page application framework.

To use you must define your individual pages within a div that has data-role="view" as an attribute.
There is no support for external html templates. It is recommended that if you plan to develop in different HTML files you use a build tool like GruntJS to compile all your HTML into a single page.
